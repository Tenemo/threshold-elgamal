# Threshold ElGamal

**WIP: Early version. Thresholds when set below the number of scheme participants don't behave as expected.**

This project implements the ElGamal encryption algorithm in TypeScript. Its core includes ElGamal functions for key generation, encryption, and decryption. It is extended with support for threshold encryption.

## TODO

-   Hashing messages

## Contributing

The JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem seems to be lacking in modern, functional ElGamal libraries that work out of the box with reasonable default (this library isn't at that point yet). All PRs are welcome.

## Setup

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system and then install the required dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```
